    "Cards can store information in a more interactive and overview-friendly manner. We therefore advise to utilize boards as the primary information management during a project.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Links then connect code and information. There are various scenarios where this is useful, but here are some suggestions:\r\n",
    " - Link your code to cards containing assumptions or background information that is relevant for it. When the information in the board is updated you can then immediately find the relevant code blocks. Also, if you use that information in multiple notebooks or code blocks the card serves as a single point of truth.\r\n",
    " - When collecting insights or result in a card, link the code that was used to generate that insight or result. For example, copy a generated plot into a card. If you link the plot generating code lines it becomes much easier for your collaborators (or even future you) to quickly modify the plot by immediately finding the generating code.\r\n",
    " - Store background reasoning (the why) in cards and link you code to them. This way the background reasoning can be browsed independent of the implementation (increases the overview), but one can immediately jump to the code blocks that depend on it."
