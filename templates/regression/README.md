# Templates for Regression

This is a collection of templates for regression with a guide to help you pick a suitable regression model.

## Getting started

Open the  guide board 'prediction.board' located in the main folder. The board asks you a set of questions. Depending on your answers, you are guided to the most suitable regression model for the task.

The folder includes another board 'regression.board' that outlines a series of steps explaining what needs to be done and a card to record information about the step to document the project.

There is also a notebook 'regression.ipynb' which is adjusted and run according to the instructions on the cards, trying about different regression models and yields the best performing.

When you follow the instructions on the instruction cards, you will create the experimental design and/or carry out the experiment and at the same time document the whole procedure on the board in the documentation cards.
