# Template for Bayesian Modelling Design of Experiments

This is a template for design of experiments for bayesian models.

## Getting started

Open the  guide board 'bayesian_modelling.board' located in this folder. The board outlines a series of steps. For each step, there is a card explaining what needs to be done in that step, and a card to record information about the step to document the project. There is also a notebook 'bayesian_modelling.ipynb', which is adjusted and run according to the instructions on the cards to compute the sets of parameters for the experiment.

When you follow the instruction on the instruction cards, you will creat the experimental design, carry out the experiment, and also document the whole procedure on the board in the documentation cards.
