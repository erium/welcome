# Templates for Data Preparation

This is a collection of templates for data preparation with a guide to help you pick suitable scripts and tools to prepare your data.

## Getting started

Open the guide board 'data_preparation_guide.board' located in the main folder. The board asks you a set of questions. Depending on your answers, you are guided to the most suitable model for the task.

This folder includes subfolders constraining template boards and notebooks corresponding to the most suitable algorithms for the prediction task at hand. You may use the template wizard to copy a template containing only the model you would like to use.
