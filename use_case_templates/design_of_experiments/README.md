# Templates for Design of Experiments

This is a collection of templates for design of experiments with a guide to help you pick one of those templates.

## Getting started

Open the  guide board 'doe_guide.board' located in the main folder. The board asks you a set of questions. Depending on your answers, you are advised to pick one of the specific templates located in one of the subfolders.

Each subfolder contains another board. That board outlines a series of steps. For each step, there is a card explaining what needs to be done in that step, and a card to record information about the step to document the project. There is also a notebook, which is adjusted and run according to the instructions on the cards to compute the sets of parameters for the experiment.

When you follow the instruction on the instruction cards, you will creat the experimental design and/or carry out the experiment and at the same time document the whole procedure on the board in the documentation cards.

This folder includes subfolders constraining template boards and notebooks corresponding to the most suitable algorithms for the design of experiments task at hand. You may use the template wizard to copy a template containing only the model you would like to use.
