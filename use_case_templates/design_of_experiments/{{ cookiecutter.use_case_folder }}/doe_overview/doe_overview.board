If a cost function is not available, you will have to design it. \nThe corresponding template will provide some guidelines.\n\nIf an iterative procedure with consecutive batches of trials is feasible, the template for optimization is best suited.\nIf instead all trials have to be planned and/or executed in one go, the template for classical DoEs is better suited.\n\n### Hidden Model Parameter estimation\nTo estimate the value of parameters that cannot be controlled or directly measured.\nFor example, these parameters might correspond to some real-world quantity you are interested in.\n\nA prerequisite is that you can express the relationship between the outcomes of a process and its adjustable parameters as a probabilistic model with model parameters.\nThese model parameters need to:\n- include the parameters that you want to estimate,\n- be a static property of the process itself and do not change from trial to trial,\n- affect the outcome of the process.\n\n\nFor this goal, the template for Bayesian modelling is best suited.\nHowever, in case all trials have to be planned and/or executed in one go, the template for classical DoEs might also be used.\n\n\n### Function fitting\nTo predict the outcome of the process as a function of the input parameters as accurately as possible.\nYou do not just want to know the best parameters, nor do you care about specific model parameters.\n\nFor this goal, the template for classical DoEs is best suited.\nHowever, if you have significant prior knowledge about the process (e.g. functional relationships), the template for Bayesian modelling may be a better choice.\n"},"edge_connections":[{"id":"1c88f08a-9f46-4f5a-acad-f8c14e9ce2ae","connector":"left"},{"id":"50601694-4567-4ce0-b950-5c5be836ca31","connector":"bottom"},{"id":"20b1b955-a507-4d8e-8188-f44cf4529ced","connector":"right"}],"type":"note","position":{"x":490.1865425999999,"y":-497.0224289999999},"size":{"width":269,"height":172.388608},"color":"#51455b","collapsed":false,"collapsed_size":{"width":269,"height":57}},{"id":"b966e67e-7dc8-4f84-8d9c-414e9bcb5988","title":"1.
