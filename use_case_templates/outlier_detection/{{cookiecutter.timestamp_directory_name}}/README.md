The folder contains a board and a notebook. The board will outline a series of steps explaining what needs to be done and a card to record information about the step to document the project. The notebook is adjusted and run according to the instructions on the cards, trying about different outlier detection algorithms and yields the results.

When you follow the instructions on the instruction cards, you will create the experimental design and/or carry out the experiment and at the same time document the whole procedure on the board in the documentation cards.

You may put your data in the data folder.
