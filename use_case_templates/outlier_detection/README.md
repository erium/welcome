# Template for Outlier Detection

This is a collection of templates for outlier detection with a guide to help you pick a suitable model.

## Getting started

Open the  guide board 'outlier_detection_guide.board' located in the main folder. The board asks you a set of questions. Depending on your answers, you are guided to the most suitable model for the task.

The {{cookiecutter.timestamp_directory_name}} folder includes subfolders constraining template boards and notebooks corresponding to the most suitable algorithms for the outlier detection task at hand. You may use cookiecutter (in cookiecutter.ipynb) to copy a project folder containing only the model you would like to use.
