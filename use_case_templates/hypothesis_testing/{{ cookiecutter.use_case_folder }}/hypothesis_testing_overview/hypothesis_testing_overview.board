WHAT HYPOTHESIS ARE YOU TESTING?","type_specific":{"message":"This template aims to answer questions related to: is x affected by/related to y? \n\nThere are different types of hypothesis that may be tested. Multiple hypotheses may be tested on each feature/set of features.\n\n## Associative Hypothesis\nPredicts if variables are linked but not whether one variable directly impacts the other variable.\n \n### Simple Hypothesis\nPredicts a correlation between an independent and dependent variable. \nEg. Dogs eat more in summer than winter\n\n### Complex Hypothesis\nSimilar to simple hypothesis but contains multiple independent and dependent variables.\nEg. Age and weight increases your chances of getting diabetes and heart disease\n\n### Null Hypothesis\nPredicts that there is no significant relationship between test variables. A simple or complex hypothesis may be phrased as a null hypothesis, but it cannot establish the direction of a relationship, only its existence.\nEg. Dogs eat the same in summer and winter\n\n### Alternative Hypothesis\nAnything other than the null hypothesis, it will disprove the null hypothesis. In practice, it is established by testing and possibly rejecting the null hypothesis.\nEg. (Against null hypothesis above) Dogs do not eat the same in summer and winter\n\n## Causal Hypothesis\nPredicts that variables are not only associated, but changes in one variable will cause changes in another. This may require some knowledge of the causal structure.\n\n### Directional Hypothesis\nMakes a prediction about the positivity or negativity of the effect of an intervention prior to the test.\nEg. Adding a charge to plastic bags lead to an increase in uptake of reusable bags.\n\n### Non-Directional Hypothesis\nSimilar to directional hypothesis but does not specify the predicted direction. This may be understood as testing if the causal relation holds.\nEg. Adding a charge to plastic bags lead to a change in uptake of reusable bags.\n\n## Formulaic Hypothesis\nPredicts that variables are linked in a certain mathematical relationship, and changes in the variables are explained by that formula.\nEg. Force = mass * acceleration\n\n\nEach hypothesis may have different pre-requisites in terms of domain knowledge and complexity of the features, which is explored further in this board.\n"},"edge_connections":[{"id":"fae5753b-8871-472e-909a-6ec554a1c73d","connector":"left"},{"id":"bd2c295f-5075-447a-b910-7ef8efc2d8b6","connector":"right"},{"id":"421ef400-7a5f-4ebf-a7f1-db726213d685","connector":"bottom"},{"id":"8b48dac7-5c6f-4740-b984-f5d44591f184","connector":"bottom"},{"id":"f0294f51-0694-4f1a-a6e1-13c248f85800","connector":"bottom"},{"id":"73bfbd1c-9a45-4542-b5bf-c16304c93922","connector":"bottom"}],"type":"note","position":{"x":-635.9648236070312,"y":121.97524047851564},"size":{"width":316.3904512,"height":255.3376},"color":"#51455b"},{"id":"010fc234-385a-4393-8dda-8e12ce758b54","title":"ASSOCIATIVE","type_specific":{"message":""},"edge_connections":[{"id":"421ef400-7a5f-4ebf-a7f1-db726213d685","connector":"top"},{"id":"14b1b781-ce36-44b5-8e9d-6f7b66e5b62d","connector":"right"},{"id":"73bfbd1c-9a45-4542-b5bf-c16304c93922","connector":"top"}],"type":"note","position":{"x":-753.8708979000002,"y":484.2734709674999},"size":{"width":114.9028864,"height":130},"color":"#125059","collapsed":true,"collapsed_size":{"width":108.19200000000001,"height":52}},{"id":"edca9dd2-0634-4e3b-9ee2-0275c14b0848","title":"CAUSAL","type_specific":{"message":""},"edge_connections":[{"id":"8b48dac7-5c6f-4740-b984-f5d44591f184","connector":"top"},{"id":"bec10762-1592-4190-b85d-be478d22a954","connector":"right"}],"type":"note","position":{"x":-525.5658585399999,"y":483.1348853674999},"size":{"width":100,"height":130},"color":"#125059","collapsed":true,"collapsed_size":{"width":100,"height":37}},{"id":"58938f8f-8ea6-44a2-ae63-4c6b71484231","title":"FORMULAIC","type_specific":{"message":""},"edge_connections":[{"id":"f0294f51-0694-4f1a-a6e1-13c248f85800","connector":"top"},{"id":"5a14f986-d2bf-47cf-967b-06c6d8722de5","connector":"right"}],"type":"note","position":{"x":-294.57089406,"y":483.95730072750007},"size":{"width":107.5497472,"height":130},"color":"#125059","collapsed":true,"collapsed_size":{"width":100,"height":52}},{"id":"1c572929-d45a-42d3-ab21-9e996659f5b8","title":"5.
