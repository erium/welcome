# Templates for Prediction

This is a collection of templates for prediction with a guide to help you pick a suitable regression or classification model.

## Getting started

Open the guide board 'prediction_guide.board' located in the main folder. The board asks you a set of questions. Depending on your answers, you are guided to the most suitable model for the task.

The {{cookiecutter.timestamp_directory_name}} folder includes subfolders constraining template boards and notebooks corresponding to the most suitable algorithms for the prediction task at hand. You may use cookiecutter (in cookiecutter.ipynb) to copy a project folder containing only the model you would like to use.
