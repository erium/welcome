Blood type), and ordinal (ordered values eg. satisfaction levels \"strongly disagree\", \"disagree\", \"agree\", \"strongly agree ).\n\n\n### Algorithm choice and encoding\nThe presence or absence of categorical variables may affect the choice of regression algorithm.\n\nSome regression algorithms (e.g. decision trees) can take both continuous and categorical variables as input. Other algorithms (such as linear regression or neural networks) require continuous quantities as direct input. \n\nTo use these algorithms with categorical variables, one has to translate these categorical quantities into continuous quantities.

Where ak are the parameters to be determined.\n\nHowever, linear regression models may not be robust enough to model the true relationships of many processes (which are nonlinear) leading to deterministic errors. It is also prone to outliers skewing the data causing an inaccurate fit.

Where ak are the parameters to be determined.\n\nHowever, polynomial regression models may prone to overfitting the data, giving low bias (good results on training data) but high variance (bad results on test and real world data). Hence polynomial regression models may need regularization to reduce errors from overfitting.\n\n### Pros\n- Useful to evaluate non-linear problems that follow polynomial patterns\n\n\n### Cons\n- Tendency to 'overfit' on training data, need to choose appropriate degree and regularization\n\n\n## Multilayer Perceptron Regression\nMultilayer perceptron regression models are a form of neural network that propagates the inputs through layers of nodes with different weights and activations. They are extremely versatile tools in modelling many different types of prediction tasks. For regression, it can produce a curve with arbitrarily large amount of complexity to predict with low deterministic error.\n\nHowever, neural networks often take a lot of time and data to train well, as well as optimization of its architecture parameters (hidden layer size etc.)\n\n### Pros\n- Very flexible, good with both linear and non-linear problems\n\n\n### Cons\n- Black box - we do not know how each independent variable is affecting the other\n- Computationally very expensive\n- Requires a lot of data, with tendency to overfit\n\n\n## Principle Component Regression\nNot a specific model but rather an extension to other regression models, suitable for problems where there are:\n1. Large number of variables\n1. High Multicollinearity\n\n\nThe issues arising from such data is termed as the 'curse of dimensionality', where fitting models in high dimensional space often requires much more data to train well.\n\nPrinciple Component Analysis (PCA) can help to find the principle components (linear combination of original features) that contribute the most to the variance in data and only use those components for regression model training and testing with the other models specified.\n\n### Pros\n- Removes correlated features, thereby improving performance\n- Reduces overfitting to data in high dimensions\n\n\n### Cons\n- Independent variables become less interpretable as they are turned into principle components\n- Information loss from the features removed\n"},"edge_connections":[{"id":"9ee3d1d9-53f0-458a-9a57-6fb989187f6a","connector":"left"},{"id":"52969a66-a867-44df-82e2-06b0c2dbef2a","connector":"right"}],"type":"note","position":{"x":2413.5264953125,"y":606.6989203124999},"size":{"width":321.64777265625,"height":302.03200000000004},"color":"#28337e"},{"id":"8b259dd9-a18e-4d84-8a34-303953e7d833","title":"CATEGORICAL AND CONTINUOUS REGRESSION MODELS","type_specific":{"message":"These are some regression models for both categorical and continuous data.
